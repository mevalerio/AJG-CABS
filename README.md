List of Academic Journals classified according to the Academic Journal Guide from CABS 

This file contains a list of journals that are classified by CABS using a star system. The star system ranges from 4* to 1, with 4* being the highest quality and 1 being the lowest. Here is a summary of what each star rating means:

4* (Journals of Distinction): These are the highest-quality journals in their field. They are recognized worldwide as leaders in their field, and they have a high impact factor, a rigorous peer review process, and publish high-quality articles.

4 (High-quality journals): These journals are also of high quality. They have a moderate impact factor, a fair peer review process, and publish good-quality articles.

3 (Good-quality journals): These journals are of good quality. They have a low impact factor, a basic peer review process, and publish fair-quality articles.

2 (Fair-quality journals): These journals are of fair quality. They have a very low impact factor, a minimal peer review process, and publish poor-quality articles.

1 (Poor-quality journals): These journals are of poor quality. They have a very low impact factor, a minimal peer review process, and publish poor-quality articles.

It is important to note that the CABS star rating system is just one way of assessing the quality of a journal. There are other factors to consider, such as the reputation of the journal, the experience of the editors and reviewers, and the relevance of the articles to your research interests.

If a journal is in the 2021 column, it will also be in the other columns. However, if a journal was not classified in 2021, but was in the classifications of previous years, it will not be present at all.
This is because the CABS star rating system is updated every three years. Journals that are not classified in a particular year may have been classified in previous years, but their star rating may have changed.
